#My first real GitHub and R project! This is probably the tenth time I've set
#up a new project. Perhaps this one is winner. If you're reading this, HUZZAH!

#This project is analyzing data from the 2005-2006 NFHS Survey in India, as
#directed by assignment questions.

#I have organzied my code with " ----" at each question name, so it should be
#easy to flip through to see what process I created and ran to answer the questions.

#Still working on figuring out how to add a folder/directory. Fingers crossed.
